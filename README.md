## About
Welcome! This analysis will delve into the world of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, a popular video game developed and published by Nintendo. More specifically, we will try to understand the various factors that contribute to the popularity of the game's characters, known as villagers, among the player base.

Here are the villager attributes we will be looking at to see how they correlate with their popularity:

- Species
- Gender
- Personality
- Hobbies
- Requests (unique requests/desires expressed by each villager in the game) 
- Song (song associated with the character)

## Installation
Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**

   You can clone this repository by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/slee502/AnimalCrossing_Villager_Popularity.git
   ```
  
3. **Navigate to the cloned directory**

   Change your current directory to the cloned repository's directory AnimalCrossing_Villager_Popularity

4. **Set up a virtual environment**

   It's recommended to create a virtual environment to keep the project's dependencies isolated from your system's Python environment.       You can create a virtual environment using the following command:

   On Windows:

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   On macOS and Linux:

   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

   This will create a new virtual environment named `venv` in your current directory.

4. **Activate the virtual environment**

   Activate the virtual environment using the following command:

   On Windows:

   ```
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS and Linux:

   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   Your prompt should change to indicate that you are now operating within a Python virtual environment. 

5. **Install the required packages**

   Install the required packages by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   You're now ready to run the project!

6. **Run the ```Villager_Popularity_Analysis.ipynb``` file:
    - If you have Jupyter Notebook installed, enter ```jupyter notebook``` and open the `.ipynb` file.
    - If you are using Visual Studio Code, open the `.ipynb` file and run the cells using the run button that appears at the top left of each cell.

To deactivate the virtual environment when you're done, simply type `deactivate` in your terminal.
